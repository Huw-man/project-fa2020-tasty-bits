## International Students Strategies

- Expand Your Network and Make it Work for You

Networking is one of the most effective ways people find out about positions and get hired.

- Refine Your Communication and Interpersonal Skills

Strong English language skills, non-verbal communication skills and interpersonal skills are all crucial for international students who wish to work and succeed in the US, and right now is the best time to polish those skills.

- Research International Employee Friendly Employers

Be intentional about your job or internship search by researching which companies have hired international candidates in the past.

- US Style Application Documents: Resume & Cover Letter

Make sure you know how to write a US style resume and cover letter and seek feedback from native speakers of English and Career Counselors at the Career Center.

- Become Confident with Interviewing

Review the Interviewing for a US employer page to explore Career Center resources on interviewing and specific tips for international students.

- Have a Plan B

Expand your pool of opportunities by applying for positions in the US and in your home country (or perhaps a third country too). Explore where your education and experiences are in demand and be open to options you previously hadnâ€™t considered!

- Understand Your Off-Campus Work Authorization and Employment Visa Options

It is essential for international students to understand when and how they can start working off campus. Students need to be able to articulate their student visa work authorization options and their employment visa options to employers, as not all U.S. employers are experienced in hiring international candidates. If you have detailed questions on student visa work authorization options, please consult with a Berkeley International Office (BIO) advisor during drop-in advising hours.

- Get Involved

It will be difficult to get a job or internship through strong grades alone. US employers value students with extracurricular activities, related hands-on experience, and leadership experience.
