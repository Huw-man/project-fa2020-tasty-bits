## Decals

Decals are student run courses that count for units. They are a great way to explore an enourmous variety of unique topics not typically offered in an academic setting, and get academic credit for it. Be on the lookout for unique classes you might be interested in every semester, as they are not permanent and change every semester. Decals are typically posted between one week before classes up until two weeks after classes have started.
