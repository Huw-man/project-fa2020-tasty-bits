# Transfer Student Resources

## Transfer Student Center

The Transfer Student Center provides services to assist students who transfer to Cal from other colleges and universities with navigating the academic and cultural landscape of this research university. Our programs and services focus on supporting a successful transition, helping transfers build connections and community, and assisting students as they explore and pursue their academic and career goals. The center plays a key role in campus outreach and recruitment through yield events and participation in programs involving California Community Colleges. We are located in 100 Cesar Chavez Student Building.
