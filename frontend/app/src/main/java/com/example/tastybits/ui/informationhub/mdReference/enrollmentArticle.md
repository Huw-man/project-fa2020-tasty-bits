# Enrollment

## Overview

Enrollment occurs during an assigned period where students can enroll for classes on [CalCentral Academics Page](https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/academics). Each student is assigned an anrollment time for Phase 1, Phase 2, and Adjustment Period. During these phases, students can enroll in a specified amount of units (i.e. typically 10.5-13.5 units for Phase 1 depending on your major's department). freshman are given the last enrollment times, while seniors are given more priority enrollment times for first pick on classes.

## Terms and Tips

- Classes count for between 1-4 "units". They are basically a way to measure how much of a workload the class takes, where more units is higher workload. During Phase 1, and Phase 2, you are limited to a cap on the amount "units" you can enroll in (the sum of the units of the classes you'd like to enroll in).

- Classes are identified by a number called a "CCN" (typically a five digit number). You can use this number to lookup the exact class you found on a class planner.

- There are three states to a class on CalCentral enrollment: "Open", "Waitlist", and "Closed".

- "Open" means that there are available seats. Sometimes trying to enroll in "Open" classes will fail, refer to the "Actually Enrolling" section in this guide.

- "Waitlist" means that the class is at capacity, and you will be placed on a first come first serve queue of students to try to enroll in the class. If enrolled students drop the class, people from the waitlist will join in the order from the queue. If you are typically placed in a position >10% of the size of the class, you might consider trying to enroll in alternative classes.

- "Closed" means you cannot enroll in the class anymore.

- Classes often come as a bundle of a lecture section, discussion section, and sometimes a lab section. They repeat at some time on certain days of the week.

- Sometimes the lecture section for a class is open, but the discussion sections, or labs are all waitlisted. Usually the professor decides that students waitlisted on a lab or discussion will not be able to join a class, but this is up to them.

- Sometimes large classes expand to accomodate more students. Google around to check for ways to get updates about these sort of things.

- Use your Phase 1 units (the very first period you can enroll in classes) for impacted classes that fufill major requirements. These classes fill up quickly.

- Do not miss your enrollment time

- Make sure lecture, discussion, and lab is factored into your schedule or you might not be able to enroll because of a scheduling conflict (i.e. overlapping time commitments).

- Sometimes enrollment will fail because a class has met their reserved seating capacity for your major. For example lets say English 29A has 200 available spots. However, it has 190 reserved seats for English majors, and 10 spots for other majors. This means only 10 people from other majors will be able to enroll, but the class will still display "Open"

- Rarely (but it happens), instructors will place enrollment restrictions on classes that will allow them to accept students on a case by case basis through a google forms application that you must submit to be considered. The class will display as "Open" but reject you from enrollment.

- Classes are sometimes offered as only "Pass, No pass (P/NP)" or option to switch to (P/NP). Basically this means that if you change your grading option to P/NP and get a C or above, the class you take will result in a P on your transcript. The class may or may not fufill the requirement you took it for if you take it P/NP, you need to check in with major requirements. Furthermore P/NP classes do not count towards your GPA.
