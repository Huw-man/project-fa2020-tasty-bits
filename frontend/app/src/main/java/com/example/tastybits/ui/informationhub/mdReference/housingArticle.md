## Price Range

At the time of writing, the average pricing on facebook groups for off-campus student housing are:

- $500-$900 for a triple about 1-8 blocks away from campus
- $600-$1200 for a double about 1-8 blocks away from campus
- $750-$1500 for a single about 1-8 blocks away from campus
- $900-$2500 for a single studio about 1-8 blocks away from campus

Pricings for dorms and campus housing can be found on their housing page, found in the "Campus housing rates" resouce above.

In 2016, the average rent for apartments is estimated by RentCafe at:

- Studio apartments: $2,004 per month
- 1-bedroom apartments: $2,796 a month
- 2-bedroom apartment: $3,526 per month

Please be advised that Cal Rentals does receive advertisements for rentals with lower rents than shown above, but house-hunters should not expect to encounter great numbers of drastically lower rents.

Although there has been new construction in Berkeley over the past few years to match the demand for housing, rents for rooms and apartments in these new buildings tend to be significantly above average.

You can expect considerable competition for any well-priced units that are near to campus.
