## What is Cal Survival Guide?

Students entering Berkeley feel a lot of anxiety and confusion around various college aspects such as class planning internships, etc. This is especially true for transfer, international, and first generation students who face extra anxiety because of their special circumstances. Cal Survival Guide is an application that is designed to relieve the anxiety for these students entering college. We built this app to help international, transfer, and first generation students situate themselves with college life at Berkeley, tackle their specific problems, and find their community.
